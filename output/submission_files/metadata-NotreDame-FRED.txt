    FRED is an agent-based model developed for modeling the 2009 influnza pandemic which simulates the spread of the virus in a population by recreating interactions among people on a daily basis.
	 Parameters were modified to represent the natural history of COVID-19. We limited interventions to school closures and shelter in place.
